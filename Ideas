Generalise the “transfer wire” mechanism - Currency Cloud

Question some of the basic concepts => accounts
Technology => what can be changed in the implementation
Think 

Payment => Once a day aggregated, based on records

Transfer => Keeping track of how much banks owe each other

Target 2=> Interconnection B/W Several Central banks 

Issues

Scale
Real time
No interoperability
Micro payment 
Separate infra for different types of “transaction”

It matters today how big a payment is=> different infra

How can it be so complex to just move data around?
